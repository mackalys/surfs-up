# Surfs-Up

## Overview
For this project, we were asked to use advanced date storage and retrieval to analyze the temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii to help an ice cream shop run all year long. We pulled the data for December and June to determine what the surf would be like so they can estimate when they will be the busiest and slowest.
