# Surfs-Up

## Overview
For this project, we were asked to use advanced date storage and retrieval to analyze the temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii to help an ice cream shop run all year long. We pulled the data for December and June to determine what the surf would be like so they can estimate when they will be the busiest or the slowest based off when surf will be high as well as the demand for ice cream.

From looking at these tables we can see the following:
1. The mean temperatues for June is 75º and December is 71º.
2. The maximum temperature for June is 85º and December is 83º.
3. The minimum temperature for June is 64º and December is 56º.
4. The standard deviation for Decemeber is slightly higher than that in June.

## Summary
These results are not all that different from one another. This can be attributed to the fact that Hawaii is located so close to the equator. December will have more variation in temperature, but that is mostly because as the earth tilts with each season, Hawaii is just a little farther away from the sun, leading to more changes in temperature. In June, Hawaii is closer to the sun leading to more consistent temperatures. There really isn't that big of a difference in temperature so an analysis of the waves and surf would be much better at determining when the ice cream shop would be the busiest.
